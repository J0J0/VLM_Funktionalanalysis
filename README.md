Here you can find my personal notes of the lecture *Funktionalanalysis*
given by *Prof. Dr. Harald Garcke* at the *University of Regensburg* in the
winter term 2013/14. (German text)

**This branch contains the chapter about Sobolev spaces in addition to the master branch.
Note that it won't be moved to the actual master branch anytime soon.**


See branch [master](https://github.com/J0J0/VLM_Funktionalanalysis/tree/master) for the master branch (without ch. 11).
See branch [master+sobolev](https://github.com/J0J0/VLM_Funktionalanalysis/tree/master+sobolev) for the master branch plus chapter 11.
