Here you can find my personal notes of the lecture *Funktionalanalysis*
given by *Prof. Dr. Harald Garcke* at the *University of Regensburg* in the
winter term 2013/14. (German text)

**Note:**
These lecture notes are neither official nor errorless.
If you find mistakes, please notify me or make a pull request.

**Unfortunately i'm kinda busy right now, so there are some sections
in the notes that i didn't have the time to review yet. As i'd like
to keep the master branch as clean as possible, it'll only include 
those parts i (at least briefly) reread. However, i will upload my
raw notes to temporary branches (listed below) for those who don't
mind reading my potentially incorrect and incomplete script.**

See branch [unstable](https://github.com/J0J0/VLM_Funktionalanalysis/tree/unstable) for everything i have.
